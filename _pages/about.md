## About me

This is the homepage of Ruoyu Li (Roy, 李若愚). I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), where I am part of [Smart Internet Group (SIG)](https://smartinternet.group/) and advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Doctor [Qing Li](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/html/919/2022-05-17/content-3985.html). I am also a research intern at [Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn). In 2019, I received the M.S. degree in Computer Science (Security Track) from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), where I was advised by Professor [Henning Schulzrinne](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/henning-schulzrinne) (IEEE & ACM Fellow) and Doctor [Gaston Ormazabal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaston-ormazabal-8304893/). In 2017, I received the B.Eng. degree in Network Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I was advised by Professor [Peng Xu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/xupeng1/zh_CN/index.htm).

I am on job market now and seeking for **postdoc/AP** positions! Feel free to contact me :-)
